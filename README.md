Welcome to the repository for all code related to my blog articles. This README will guide you on how to navigate and use the materials present in this repository.

My blog can be found [here](https://medium.com/@markstent)

## Overview

The aim of this repository is to provide an open-source code companion to the articles published on myblog. Each article that includes code snippets or datasets will have a corresponding Jupyter notebook in this repository, allowing you to follow along and experiment on your own.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
.
├── README.md
├── article_1
│   └── notebook.ipynb
├── article_2
│   └── notebook.ipynb
└── ...
```

Each article has its own directory. Inside each article directory, you will find the Jupyter notebook (`notebook.ipynb`) associated with the article, and any files used for the article.

## Articles

1. **Title: An introduction to creating plots in Matplotlib**
